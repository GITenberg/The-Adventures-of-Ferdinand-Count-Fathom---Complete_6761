description: "The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom is a novel by Tobias Smollett\
  \ first published in 1753. It was Smollett's third novel and met with less success\
  \ than his two previous more picaresque tales. The central character is a villainous\
  \ dandy who cheats, swindles and philanders his way across Europe and England with\
  \ little concern for the law or the welfare of others. The son of an equally disreputable\
  \ mother, Smollett himself comments that \"Fathom justifies the proverb, 'What's\
  \ bred in the bone will never come out of the flesh\". Sir Walter Scott commented\
  \ that the novel paints a \"complete picture of human depravity\" [1]\nThe main\
  \ character reappears as a minor character in Smollet's later novel The Expedition\
  \ of Humphry Clinker.\nThe novel's elements of terror and the supernatural have\
  \ caused some historians of English literature to describe it as anticipating the\
  \ themes of the Gothic novel.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
